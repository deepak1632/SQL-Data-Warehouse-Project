### 🏗️ Data Architecture
This project implements the Medallion Architecture with Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers to structure the data flow:

*  Bronze Layer: Raw, unprocessed data as ingested from source systems. Here, data is loaded from CSV files into a SQL Server database.
*  Silver Layer: Cleansed, standardized, and normalized data, prepared for analysis.
*  Gold Layer: Business-ready, analytics-friendly data modeled in a star schema for reporting and insights.
